# PerfSend
PerfSend is an SMS campaign delivery system that utilizes your mobile plan for SMS usage. It provides the ability to send targeted SMS messages by integrating information such as name, first name, company, or any other type of data contained in a .csv file.

***Please note that some operators, such as in France, advertise an 'unlimited' plan, but in reality, there is a limit that, once reached, can result in your line being blocked. I recommend checking your plan details on your provider's website before using this program. For businesses, I recommend using an M2M SIM card designed specifically for this type of usage.***
